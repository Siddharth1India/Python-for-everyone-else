    "## 💻 What is programming in layman's terms❓ \n",
    "Programming is like giving instructions to a computer to perform a task. Just like how we give instructions to our friends or family members, we give instructions to a computer using a special language that it understands. This language is called a programming language, and it allows us to communicate with the computer and tell it what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a programming language as a set of rules or guidelines that we follow to write code, which is a series of instructions for the computer to execute. These instructions can be as simple as adding two numbers together or as complex as creating a website or a video game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is like solving a puzzle or building with blocks. We use different tools and techniques to create a sequence of instructions that the computer can understand and follow. These instructions can be combined in various ways to create different outcomes or achieve specific goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is an essential skill in today's technology-driven world, as it allows us to create software applications, websites, and other digital tools that make our lives easier and more convenient.
