    "## üíª What is programming in layman's terms‚ùì \n",
    "Programming is like giving instructions to a computer to perform a task. Just like how we give instructions to our friends or family members, we give instructions to a computer using a special language that it understands. This language is called a programming language, and it allows us to communicate with the computer and tell it what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a programming language as a set of rules or guidelines that we follow to write code, which is a series of instructions for the computer to execute. These instructions can be as simple as adding two numbers together or as complex as creating a website or a video game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is like solving a puzzle or building with blocks. We use different tools and techniques to create a sequence of instructions that the computer can understand and follow. These instructions can be combined in various ways to create different outcomes or achieve specific goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is an essential skill in today's technology-driven world, as it allows us to create software applications, websites, and other digital tools that make our lives easier and more convenient.

    "### Comments in Python\n",
    "Comments in Python are used to add human-readable explanations or notes to the code that are not executed by the interpreter. They are used to provide documentation, add explanations, or disable specific lines of code temporarily for testing or debugging purposes. Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter and do not affect the execution of the program.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Single-line comments\n",
    "Single-line comments start with the \"#\" symbol and continue until the end of the line. Anything written after the \"#\" symbol on the same line is considered a comment and is ignored by the interpreter. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# This is a single-line comment in Python\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above example, the comment \"This is a single-line comment in Python\" is added after the \"#\" symbol, and it does not affect the execution of the \"print\" statement.\n",
    "2. Multi-line comments\n",
    "Multi-line comments, also known as docstrings, are used to write comments that span across multiple lines. Multi-line comments are enclosed in triple quotes (''' or \"\"\") at the beginning and end of the comment block. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "This is a multi-line comment in Python\n",
    "It can span across multiple lines\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",

    "```\n",
    "In the above example, the comment \"This is a multi-line comment in Python\" is written within triple quotes and spans across multiple lines. It is ignored by the interpreter and does not affect the execution of the \"print\" statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are an important part of writing clean and maintainable code. They provide explanations and documentation that can help other programmers understand the code and make it easier to debug and troubleshoot. It is good practice to add comments to your Python code to make it more understandable and maintainable.\n"

    "### Datatypes in Python\n",
    "Let's first see basic idea of datatypes. We will learn about them as we write code. And some of them will be covered in details as per requirements and importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a data type refers to the type of value that can be stored in a variable (We will see what is variable in next section, till than, just undersatnd it as same variable we have in mathematics). It specifies the kind of data that a variable can hold, such as numbers, text, or collections of values. Data types in Python determine the operations that can be performed on the values, as well as the memory space required to store the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "While writing code, it is your responsibility as a programmer to use appropriate datatype for each variable. \n",
    "Here, Python does great job for you which many programming languages do not. Data types in Python are dynamically typed, meaning that you do not need to explicitly specify the data type of a variable when declaring it. Python automatically determines the data type based on the value assigned to the variable. For example, if you assign an integer value to a variable, Python automatically recognizes it as an integer data type. This dynamic typing feature makes Python a flexible and powerful language for handling different types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Basic data types in Python:\n",
    "1. Integer (int): Represents whole numbers without any decimal points.\n",
    "2. Float (float): Represents numbers with decimal points or floating-point numbers.\n",
    "3. Complex: (complex): Represents complex numbers.\n",
    "4. Boolean (bool): Represents either True or False, used for logical operations.\n",
    "5. String (str): Represents a sequence of characters, such as text or words.\n",
    "6. List (list): Represents an ordered collection of items, which can be of any data type.\n",
    "7. Tuple (tuple): Represents an ordered, immutable collection of items, which can be of any data type.\n",
    "8. Set (set): Represents an unordered collection of unique items, used for mathematical set operations.\n",
    "9. Dictionary (dict): Represents a collection of key-value pairs, used for mapping keys to values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see basic example of each of them now. We will learn about string, list, tuple, set and dict in details later. "

    "Operators are symbols or special characters in Python that are used to perform operations on values and variables. Here are some common types of operators in Python:\n",
    "1. Arithmetic Operators:\n",
    "    - `Addition (+)`: Adds two values.\n",
    "    - `Subtraction (-)`: Subtracts the right-hand operand from the left-hand operand.\n",
    "    - `Multiplication (*)`: Multiplies two values.\n",
    "    - `Division (/)`: Divides the left-hand operand by the right-hand operand.\n",
    "    - `Modulus (%)`: Returns the remainder of the division between two values.\n",
    "    - `Exponentiation (**)`: Raises a value to a given power.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Comparison Operators:\n",
    "    - `Equal to (==)`: Checks if two values are equal.\n",
    "    - `Not equal to (!=)`: Checks if two values are not equal.\n",
    "    - `Greater than (>)`: Checks if the left-hand operand is greater than the right-hand operand.\n",
    "    - `Less than (<)`: Checks if the left-hand operand is less than the right-hand operand.\n",
    "    - `Greater than or equal to (>=)`: Checks if the left-hand operand is greater than or equal to the right-hand operand.\n",
    "    - `Less than or equal to (<=)`: Checks if the left-hand operand is less than or equal to the right-hand operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Logical Operators:\n",
    "    - `Logical AND (and)`: Returns True if both operands are True, otherwise False.\n",
    "    - `Logical OR (or)`: Returns True if at least one operand is True, otherwise False.\n",
    "    - `Logical NOT (not)`: Returns the opposite of the operand's boolean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Assignment Operators:\n",
    "    - `Assignment (=)`: Assigns a value to a variable.\n",
    "    - `Addition assignment (+=)`: Adds a value to the variable and assigns the result back to the variable.\n",
    "    - `Subtraction assignment (-=)`: Subtracts a value from the variable and assigns the result back to the variable.\n",
    "    - `Multiplication assignment (*=)`: Multiplies the variable by a value and assigns the result back to the variable.\n",
    "    - `Division assignment (/=)`: Divides the variable by a value and assigns the result back to the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Other Operators:\n",
    "    - `String concatenation (+)`: Concatenates two strings.\n",
    "    - `Membership (in)`: Returns True if a value is found in a sequence, such as a list or a string.\n",
    "    - `Identity (is)`: Returns True if two operands refer to the same object in memory.\n",
    "    - `Indexing ([])`: Accesses an element in a sequence by its index."
